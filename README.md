# CS513-Data-Mining-and-Knowledge-Discovery
In order to diagnose the problem of what factors positively and negatively contribute to a startup companies' success, my group used data science and machine learning techniques to make accurate inferences on the data on these companies. To achieve these accurate conclusions, various machine learning algorithms were used: k-nearest neighbor, naive bayes, classification and regression tree, random forest, C5.0 classification, and artificial neural networks.
